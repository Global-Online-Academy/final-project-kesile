# Google Trends Predictor
## Introduction
The Google Trends Predictor is a data-driven project that aims to predict the future of trending topics using Google Trends data. This project reads images from Google Trends, utilizes the ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model to forecast future trends, and visualizes the results using Bokeh.

## Data Sources
The project uses the Google Trend data for Yan LeCun's search interest, the Eras tour, the election, ChatGPT, and the Boston Marathon.

## Methodology
1. Data Extraction: The project reads the Google Trends data from the provided images.
2. Time Series Analysis: The ARIMA model is used to predict the future trends based on the historical data.
3. Visualization: The predicted trends are visualized using a line graph in Bokeh, as it is the most suitable representation for sequential time series data.

## Results and Insights
From the visualization and analysis, the following insights were drawn:
1. While it is possible to predict some trends with reasonable accuracy, the human trend cycle and news events are too complex to predict with purely computational models.
2. The accuracy of the predictions may be limited due to the dynamic nature of trends and the influence of external factors that are not captured in the data.

## Additional Questions

### Limitations of the Approach
What are the potential limitations of using the ARIMA model and Google Trends data to predict future trends? How can these limitations be addressed?
### Incorporating External Factors
How can the model be improved to incorporate external factors, such as news events, social media activity, and other relevant data sources, to enhance the accuracy of the predictions?
### Ensemble Modeling
Could the use of ensemble modeling techniques, which combine multiple forecasting methods, improve the overall predictive performance of the system?
### Real-time Monitoring and Adaptation
How can the system be designed to continuously monitor and adapt to changes in trends, allowing for more accurate and timely predictions over time?
### Ethical Considerations 
What ethical implications should be considered when using predictive models to forecast trends, especially those that may have societal or political implications?

## Conclusion

The Google Trends Predictor demonstrates the potential and limitations of using computational models to forecast future trends. While the approach can provide valuable insights, the complexity of human behavior and external factors highlights the need for a more comprehensive and adaptive approach to trend prediction. Addressing the additional questions raised can help improve the accuracy and reliability of the system, while also considering the ethical implications of such predictive models.
